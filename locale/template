version @1@nSETUP: For interactive setup punch the mover and then punch source1, source2, target node (follow instructions). Put the mover directly next to a battery. For advanced setup right click mover. Positions are defined by x y z coordinates (see top of mover for orientation). Mover itself is at coordinates 0, 0, 0.=
#
@n@nMODES of operation: normal (just teleport block), dig (digs and gives you resulted node - good for harvesting farms); by setting 'filter' only selected node is moved, drop (drops node on ground), object (teleportation of players and objects) - distance between source1/2 defines teleport radius; by setting 'filter' you can specify move time - [0.2, 20] - for non players.@
After changing from/to object mode, you need to reconfigure sources position.@
Inventory mode can exchange items between node inventories. You need to select inventory name for source/target from the dropdown list on the right.@
@nADVANCED:@
You can reverse start/end position by setting reverse nonzero. This is useful for placing stuff at many locations-planting. If you put reverse @= 2/3 in transport mode it will disable parallel transport but will still do reverse effect with 3. If you activate mover with OFF signal it will toggle reverse.=
#
@n@nFUEL CONSUMPTION depends on blocks to be moved and distance. For example, stone or tree is harder to move than dirt, harvesting wheat is very cheap and and moving lava is very hard.@
@nUPGRADE mover by moving mese blocks in upgrade inventory. Each mese block increases mover range by @1, fuel consumption is divided by (number of mese blocks)+1 in upgrade. Max @2 blocks are used for upgrade.@

@n4 numbers in each row represent (from left to right): first 3 numbers are target coordinates x y z, last number (MODE) controls how signal is passed to target.@
For example, to only pass OFF signal use -2, to only pass ON use 2, -1 negates the signal, 1 passes original signal, 0 blocks signal.@
delay option adds delay to activations, in seconds. A negative delay activation is randomized with probability -delay/1000.@
view button toggles view of target names, in names view there is button scan which automatically scans for valid targets in a box defined by first and second target.@
@nADVANCED:@
You can use the distributor as an event handler - it listens to events like interact attempts and chat around the distributor.@
You need to place the distributor at a position (x, y, z), with coordinates of the form (20*i, 20*j+1, 20*k) for some integers i, j, k.@
Left click while holding sneak key with a distributor in the hand to show a suitable position.@
Then you need to configure first row of numbers in the distributor:@
by putting 0 as MODE it will start to listen. First number x @= 0/1 controls if node listens to failed interact attempts around it, second number y @= -1/0/1 controls listening to chat (-1 additionally mutes chat)=

When target is distributor, you can change i-th target of distributor to mode mode with "i mode".@
@nKeyboard: To use keypad as keyboard for text input write "@@" in "text" field and set any password. Next time keypad is used it will work as text input device.@
@nDisplaying messages to nearby players (up to 5 blocks around keypad's target): Set text to "!text". Upon activation player will see "text" in their chat.@

SETUP: Right click or punch and follow chat instructions. With a detector you can detect nodes, objects, players, items inside inventories, nodes information and light levels. If detector activates it will trigger machine at target position.@
@nThere are 6 modes of operation - node/player/object/inventory/infotext/light detection. Inside detection filter write node/player/object name or infotext/light level. If you detect node/player/object you can specify a range of detection. If you want detector to activate target precisely when its not triggered set output signal to 1.@
@nFor example, to detect empty space write air, to detect tree write default:tree, to detect ripe wheat write farming:wheat_8, for flowing water write default:water_flowing... If mode is inventory it will check for items in specified inventory of source node like a chest.@
@nADVANCED:@
In inventory (must set a filter)/node detection mode, you can specify a second source and then select AND/OR from the right top dropdown list to do logical operations.@
You can also filter output signal in any modes:@
-2@=only OFF, -1@=NOT, 0/1@=normal, 2@=only ON, 3@=only if changed, 4@=if target is keypad set its text to detected object name.=

This machine can move anything. General idea is the following:@

@nCHECK why it doesn't work: 1. did you click OK in mover after changing setting 2. does it have battery, 3. does battery have enough fuel 4. did you set filter for taking out of chest ?@
