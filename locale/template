Put charged battery next to it and start it with keypad/mese signal.=MOVER: Battery found - displaying mark 1=MOVER: Please put battery nearby=MOVER HELP=version @1@nSETUP: For interactive setup punch the mover and then punch source1, source2, target node (follow instructions). Put the mover directly next to a battery. For advanced setup right click mover. Positions are defined by x y z coordinates (see top of mover for orientation). Mover itself is at coordinates 0, 0, 0.=@n@nMODES of operation: normal (just teleport block), dig (digs and gives you resulted node - good for harvesting farms); by setting 'filter' only selected node is moved, drop (drops node on ground), object (teleportation of players and objects) - distance between source1/2 defines teleport radius; by setting 'filter' you can specify move time - [0.2, 20] - for non players.@nAfter changing from/to object mode, you need to reconfigure sources position.@nInventory mode can exchange items between node inventories. You need to select inventory name for source/target from the dropdown list on the right.@n@nADVANCED:@nYou can reverse start/end position by setting reverse nonzero. This is useful for placing stuff at many locations-planting. If you put reverse @= 2/3 in transport mode it will disable parallel transport but will still do reverse effect with 3. If you activate mover with OFF signal it will toggle reverse.=@n@nFUEL CONSUMPTION depends on blocks to be moved, distance and temperature. For example, stone or tree is harder to move than dirt, harvesting wheat is very cheap and and moving lava is very hard. High temperature increases fuel consumption while low temperature reduces it.@n@nUPGRADE mover by moving mese blocks in upgrade inventory. Each mese block increases mover range by @1, fuel consumption is divided by number of mese blocks in upgrade. Max @2 blocks are used for upgrade.@n@nActivate mover by keypad/detector signal or mese signal through mesecon adapter (if mesecons mod).=DISTRIBUTOR: Position @1 is protected. Aborting.=DISTRIBUTOR: All coordinates must be between @1 and @2.=DISTRIBUTOR: Connected @1 targets.=DISTRIBUTOR HELP=SETUP: To select target nodes for activation click SET then click target node.@nYou can add more targets with ADD. To see where target node is click SHOW button next to it.@n@n4 numbers in each row represent (from left to right): first 3 numbers are target coordinates x y z, last number (MODE) controls how signal is passed to target.@nFor example, to only pass OFF signal use -2, to only pass ON use 2, -1 negates the signal, 1 passes original signal, 0 blocks signal.@ndelay option adds delay to activations, in seconds. A negative delay activation is randomized with probability -delay/1000.@nview button toggles view of target names, in names view there is button scan which automatically scans for valid targets in a box defined by first and second target.@n@nADVANCED:@nYou can use the distributor as an event handler - it listens to events like interact attempts and chat around the distributor.@nYou need to place the distributor at a position (x, y, z), with coordinates of the form (20*i, 20*j+1, 20*k) for some integers i, j, k.@nLeft click while holding sneak key with a distributor in the hand to show a suitable position.@nThen you need to configure first row of numbers in the distributor:@nby putting 0 as MODE it will start to listen. First number x @= 0/1 controls if node listens to failed interact attempts around it, second number y @= -1/0/1 controls listening to chat (-1 additionally mutes chat)=DISTRIBUTOR: Punch the position to set target @1.=KEYPAD: Position is protected.

Password will be encrypted. Next time you use keypad you will need to enter correct password to gain access.@n@nText: If set then text on target node will be changed. In case target is detector/mover, filter settings will be changed. Can be used for special operations.@n@nTarget: Represents coordinates (x, y, z) relative to keypad. (0, 0, 0) is keypad itself, (0, 1, 0) is one node above, (0, -1, 0) one node below. X coordinate axes goes from east to west, Y from down to up, Z from south to north.@n@n****************@nUsage@n****************@n=@nJust punch (left click) keypad, then the target block will be activated.@nTo set text on other nodes (text shows when you look at node) just target the node and set nonempty text. Upon activation text will be set. When target node is another keypad, its "text" field will be set. When targets is mover/detector, its "filter" field will be set. To clear "filter" set text to "@@". When target is distributor, you can change i-th target of distributor to mode mode with "i mode".@n@nKeyboard: To use keypad as keyboard for text input write "@@" in "text" field and set any password. Next time keypad is used it will work as text input device.@n@nDisplaying messages to nearby players (up to 5 blocks around keypad's target): Set text to "!text". Upon activation player will see "text" in their chat.@n@nPlaying sound to nearby players: set text to "$sound_name", optionally followed by a space and pitch value: 0.01 to 10. Can choose a sound with sounds menu.=@n@nADVANCED:@nText replacement: Suppose keypad A is set with text "@@Some @@. text @@!" and there are blocks on top of keypad A with infotext '1' and '2'. Suppose we target B with A and activate A. Then text of keypad B will be set to "some 1. text 2!".@nWord extraction: Suppose similar setup but now keypad A is set with text "%1". Then upon activation text of keypad B will be set to 1.st word of infotext.=ACCESS DENIED. WRONG PASSWORD.=ACCESS GRANTED=Operation aborted by user. Punch to activate.=DETECTOR: Position is protected. Aborting.=DETECTOR: All coordinates must be between @1 and @2.=DETECTOR HELP=SETUP: Right click or punch and follow chat instructions. With a detector you can detect nodes, objects, players, items inside inventories, nodes information and light levels. If detector activates it will trigger machine at target position.@n@nThere are 6 modes of operation - node/player/object/inventory/infotext/light detection. Inside detection filter write node/player/object name or infotext/light level. If you detect node/player/object you can specify a range of detection. If you want detector to activate target precisely when its not triggered set output signal to 1.@n@nFor example, to detect empty space write air, to detect tree write default:tree, to detect ripe wheat write farming:wheat_8, for flowing water write default:water_flowing... If mode is inventory it will check for items in specified inventory of source node like a chest.@n@nADVANCED:@nIn inventory (must set a filter)/node detection mode, you can specify a second source and then select AND/OR from the right top dropdown list to do logical operations.@nYou can also filter output signal in any modes:@n-2@=only OFF, -1@=NOT, 0/1@=normal, 2@=only ON, 3@=only if changed, 4@=if target is keypad set its text to detected object name.=Mesecon Adapter: place machine to be activated on top=Mesecon Adapter=This will move blocks as they are - without change=This will transform blocks as if player dug them=This will take block/item out of chest (you need to set filter) and will drop it=Make TELEPORTER/ELEVATOR:@n This will move any object inside a sphere (with center source1 and radius defined by distance between source1/source2) to target position@n For ELEVATOR, teleport origin/destination need to be placed exactly in same coordinate line with mover, and you need to upgrade with 1 diamond block for every 100 height difference=This will move items from inventory of any block at source position to any inventory of block at target position=This will move all blocks at source area to new area starting at target position@nThis mode preserves all inventories and other metadata=normal=dig=drop=transport=MODE OF OPERATION=WHERE TO MOVE=description=FILTER=Source inventory=Target inventory=Now=Show=INPUT AREA - mover will dig here=TARGET POSITION - mover will move to here=REVERSE source and target (0/1/2/3)=Toggle mover introduction=Mover introduction disabled=Mover introduction enabled=Mover block.
